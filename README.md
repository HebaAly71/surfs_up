# Surfs_up Challenge
### Important files:
#### 1) Challenge_flask.py
#### 2) challenge.ipynb
##### Please note that the file challenge_wout_flask.py is a file with python code is getting the same data for month of June and December but without using the flask api which I guess isn't required for this challenge.

Please note that the results, analysis, and recommmendations for the challenge is all embedded in the challenge.ipynb file as a markdown.
